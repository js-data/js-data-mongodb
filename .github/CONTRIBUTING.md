# Contributing to js-data-mongodb

Dear contributor,

**Thank you!** Projects like this are successful because of you!

## Getting started

1. Read the the general [JSData Contributing Guide](http://js-data.io/docs/contributing)
1. To report a bug or request a feature, please [open an issue](https://github.com/js-data/js-data-mongodb/issues/new)
  * Be sure to search the existing issues to prevent duplication
  * Give your issue a short but descriptive title
  * For bug reports, please include all steps to reproduce the error
  * For feature requests, please include details of your use case
1. To improve to the JSData + MongoDB tutorial, go to [js-data.io/v3.0/docs/js-data-mongodb](http://www.js-data.io/v3.0/docs/js-data-mongodb) and click "Suggest Edits"
1. To improve the API Reference Documentation, write a test, fix a bug, or add a feature:
  1. Create a fork of github.com/js-data/js-data-mongodb. [Click here](https://github.com/js-data/js-data-mongodb#fork-destination-box) to do so now.
  1. Clone your fork:

      ```
      git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/js-data-mongodb.git
      ```
  1. Change directory to `js-data-mongodb`:

      ```
      cd js-data-mongodb
      ```
  1. Install development dependencies

      ```
      npm install js-data@rc bson mongodb
      npm install
      ```
1. To just update API Reference Documentation, make changes to the [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) comments in the source code. To regenerate the API documentation:

    ```
    npm run doc
    ```

    You can find the regenerated API Reference Documentation in the `doc/` folder.
1. To write a test, fix a bug, or add a feature, make your changes to files in the `src/` and `test/` folders.
1. To run the tests, first make sure MongoDB is running in another terminal window:

    ```
    mongod --config /path/to/mongod.conf
    ```
1. Now run the tests:

    ```
    npm test
    ```

1. Commit your changes, submit a Pull Request, and wait for review!
